# TytoDB-Tests
## test-0.1
The first test towards TytoDB, it spam the databases with cycles of requests, making it run operations like row creation, deletion and edition. The requests are randomly generated by making use of functions in "command_generator.py", then sent to the database, the operations are divided in cycles of 100 requests.
The test ends after 100 hours or 1B requests, even while the first TytoDB test didn't reach 1B, but 11M, I think the reached number is enough to ensure consistency and endurance from the database.
